Title: Analysis of Genotype-phenotype correlations in protein multiple sequence alignments
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Leon Eyrich Jessen
Maintainer: Leon Eyrich Jessen <leon.jessen@gmail.com>
Description: SigniSite performs residue level genotype phenotype correlation in protein multiple sequence alignments by identifying amino acid residues significantly associated with the phenotype of the data set.
    Input is a protein multiple sequence alignment in FASTA format. The phenotype is represented by a real-valued numerical parameter placed white-space separated, last in the identifier of each sequence
