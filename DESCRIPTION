Description: SigniSite performs residue level genotype phenotype correlation in protein
             multiple sequence alignments by identifying amino acid residues significantly 
             associated with the phenotype of the data set. Input is a protein multiple 
             sequence alignment in FASTA format. The phenotype is represented by a real-valued 
             numerical parameter placed white-space separated, last in the identifier of each sequence.
